# Lab6

This program basically is a grade calculator. The program asks the user to manually
input scores of all the assignments and then display the currents students grade.
A scanner is used to scan in user input into 8 different arrays. A raw score and
the total score is scanned in into the appropriate arrays. Furthermore, four different
for loops are used to place numbers into their respective array. The four assignments
mentioned in the program are Practice Problems, Labs, Midterms, and Final Exam.
If the user enter 999 during the for loop, this indicates to the program that
the student has not received a score on the remaining assignments and therefore 
should be totaled separately. After all user data is entered, the program will
display 1 of 2 messages. If there aren't any remaining assignments, the final grade
will be displayed. On the other hand, if there are assignments remaining, the program
will display the total amount of points remaining for each assignment section and then
display the students current grade in the class. All input and output is done
through the System.out output.

**You need to run the Lab6.java file which is located in the src folder. No other files are needed.**
